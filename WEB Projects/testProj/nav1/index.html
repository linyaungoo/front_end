        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As a front-end developer, I am passionate about creating visually stunning and user-friendly websites and applications.
                 My expertise lies in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly learning new tools and technologies to enhance my skills.
                  I am a proud alumnus of the University of Computer Studies, Mandalay, where I majored in Software Engineering. During my time there,
                   I gained a solid foundation in programming fundamentals, algorithms, and data structures, which has served me well in my career. I am also a
                    strong collaborator and communicator, and I love working with others to bring their ideas to life. In my free time, I enjoy reading about the
                     latest tech trends and exploring new programming languages. Overall, 
                I am deeply committed to my craft and am excited to see where my skills and experiences will take me next.</p>
